# PHPGraphLib Graphing Library
### This is a fork from elliotb/phpgraphlib

PHPGraphLib was no longer maintained and not functional with PHP 7.x and up
## Planned releases
*  2.0-legacy-stable release is the last release by Elliotb
*  v3.0 is PHP 7.x compatible
*  v3.1 will include some of my extras I put on the original PHPGraphLib release (before Github)

The text below will be updated and demos will be restored if possible. I will also try to recreate the documentation.
On this link an web archive of the documentation is stored:

Thank you.

### PHPGraphLib is a lightweight PHP-based graphing library that creates slick PHP graphs for incorporation into a website or application.

PHPGraphLib has powerful customization features, allowing you to generate the perfect bar, line, stacked bar, or pie graph for any application. Used with dynamic data, PHPGraphLib allows easy visual interpretation of sophisticated data sets. Simply feed PHPGraphLib an array of data points, and it will generate a .png chart of your data dynamically for browser display or saved to your filesystem.

### History

The first version PHPGraphLib was written in 2007 by Elliott Brueggeman to deliver PHP generated graphs quickly and easily to PHP4 applications. It has grown in both features and maturity since its inception. PHPGraphLib now requires PHP5+. Originally available only for paid commercial use, PHPGraphLib was open-sourced in 2013 under the MIT License.
